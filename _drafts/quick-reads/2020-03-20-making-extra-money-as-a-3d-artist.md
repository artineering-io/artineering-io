An additional income is always welcome and, as a 3D artist, this can be achieved by furthering your 3D skills and artistry. Here are some ideas to make money on the side as a 3D artist:

### Selling 3D Models Online
Many businesses need 3D models for their next ad, short film or game. As a 3D artist, you have the most suited skillset to create outstanding and high-quality 3D models to cater to any potential client’s needs. Check out some 3D marketplaces such as [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/), [Sketchfab Store](https://sketchfab.com/store), [CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/), [DAZ 3D](https://www.daz3d.com/shop/), [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) and [CGStudio](https://www.cgstudio.com/), where you can sell your 3D models.

### Affiliate Marketing
If you have your own blog or have established yourself on social media with a sizable following, affiliate marketing could be ideal for you. Affiliate marketing allows an affiliate (you) to earn a commission for promoting/marketing a company’s product. By promoting a product that you enjoy and providing an affiliate link for others to buy it, you can get money for every product sold through that link.

Many software companies offer affiliate marketing programs to 3D artists that already use their product, including us! If you are interested in joining Artineering’s affiliate program, send us an [email](mailto:affiliate@artineering.io) and we will get back to you with further details.

### Creating a 3D Course
Are you a 3D artist with many years of industry experience and seasoned skillset? Then you are the perfect candidate to share your knowledge with others. On paid online learning platforms like [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/) or [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/), you can make your own courses and tutorials on what you already know. If you cover a topic in high demand, the enrolment of your courses could go up to hundreds of students. You can further market yourself  on social media and establish your own brand.

### Freelancing
There are many platforms which facilitate work on freelance projects (aka. Gigs), such as Upwork or Fiverr. [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) projects offer one-time or hourly pay, depending on what the client is looking for. [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) is another alternative, which tends to attract more clients, as prices seem in general lower than its competition. However, you can still offer basic services for a fixed price and provide the option for further customization on top.

None of these methods will make you financially independent overnight. Therefore, start them as a side project to make some extra money and polish your 3D skills during your free time. Most importantly, keep creating awesome artwork!

What are you waiting for? Go enhance your skills while earning some extra money!

**Notes:** If you are employed, you’ll need to thread carefully when earning a side income, as this might not be allowed under some employment contracts. Make sure to clarify this with your boss or legal advisor beforehand.  Also, depending on where you are living, side income could be taxed, so make sure to also check on this so all your hard earnings are legal.
