2020 has started with the COVID-19 pandemic, that affects all industry from travel to film production. Amid the economic and job market's uncertainty caused by this health crisis, here are some ideas to make money on the side as a 3D artist.

### Selling 3D Model Online
Many production houses need basic 3D models for their next ad, short films or games. It’s up to you to provide high quality, special software formatting, to be creative enough and think of additional features that may highlight and put that particular model above the rest.
You can check [DAZ3d](https://www.daz3d.com/), [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/), [Turbosquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/) and [CG studio](https://www.cgstudio.com/) to start selling.

### Affiliate Marketing
Many artists might not be familiar with affiliate marketing. If you have your own blog or already established yourself on social channels, affiliate marketing can be a nice addition to your income. Affiliate marketing is the process by which an affiliate earns a commission for marketing another company’s products. The affiliate simply searches for a product they enjoy, then promotes that product and earns a piece of the profit from each sale they make. The sales are tracked via affiliate links from one website to another.

Many software companies offer affiliate marketing programs to 3D artists that already use their program, including us! If you are interested in joining Artineering's affiliate program, [email us](mailto:antoinette@artineering.io) and we will get back to you with the details.

### Creating a 3D Course
If you have tons of industry experience and skills, chances are, there are people who are eager to learn from you.  Make your own course and tutorials on online learning platforms like [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/) or [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). This can be a good source of income as some of the courses go up to hundreds of enrollments. Multiply the price by the number of students, the result is a nice pay. You can also build yourself as a brand on social media to help market your course.

### Working Freelance
There are many platforms that you can use to look for a freelance gig 	
as a 3D artist, such as Upwork or Fiverr. [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) offers a decent one time or hourly pay, depending on what the client is looking for. This is good for artists that are looking to build a long term relationship with clients to secure potential future projects. On the other extreme, there is [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/) that has low rates for 3D artists but you have the ability to upsell and it also brings you many clients. The trick here is to create a general model in a niche. For example, if you are targetting clients who look for environment modeling, you may want to make sofas or other furniture and list them online. Some artists do a quick and decent general model during their one-hour lunch break and charge for $100. If the client wants customization, you can charge them extra. The client can also just purchase your ready-made basic model as is.

None of the above-mentioned methods are a "get rich quick" scheme or "passive". You still have to put the work and efforts to succeed. However, if you are polishing your skills during your free time, why not make your artworks earn some side income while you're at it.
