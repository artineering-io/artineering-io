Alex is increasingly getting tired of adult life. Her daily routine is restricted by norms and expectations of the modern world, and social media have replaced human interaction. But things changed when she sees Bacchus.

BACCHUS was made by a team of 3rd-year Character Animation & CG Art students at The Animation Workshop/VIA University College in Viborg, Denmark. Check out the project blog  [here](https://bacchus-taw.tumblr.com/)
