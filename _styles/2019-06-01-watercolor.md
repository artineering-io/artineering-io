The _Watercolor Stylization_ brings real-time watercolor to 3D objects and animation within _Autodesk Maya_!

The _Watercolor_ style emulates the **traditional watercolor animation** aesthetic, without the usual flickering associated with when showing multiple watercolor paintings in sequence. Based on the award-winning research of Montesdeoca et al. and Bousseau et al., we are continuously improving upon it with new effects and controls.

### Main Features
* Pigment-based effects such as **pigment turbulence and bleeding**
* Edge-based effects such as **edge darkening and gaps & overlaps**
* Substrate-based effects such as **paper granulation and distortion**
* Substrate can be attached to the underlying motion
* Use PaintFX and NoiseFX to **attach effects** onto the animation
* Use proxies to **control the style with invisible objects**
* The stylization is also **available in Nuke** for Indie/Studio subscribers to add the watercolor style to offline renders (i.e., Arnold, Renderman)

The style can be **[art-directed](/software/MNPRX/docs/art-direction/)** at each level of control with **[MNPRX](/software/MNPRX/)** and its **[uber material](/software/MNPRX/docs/uber/)**.

## Style attributes

To refine and customize the watercolor style, a series of global watercolor attributes are provided within the [style configuration node](/software/MNPRX/docs/config#style-attributes).

### Pigment Density
The concentration of pigments, giving the render either a diluted or a more saturated and darker look.

	</video>
	<figcaption>Pigment Density between 0.5 and 2.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Paper Granulation
The accumulation of pigments on the valleys of the paper (substrate). Concentrates the pigments on the valleys and creates a more saturated and darker look.

### Edge Darkening
* **Simple** - Simple control over edges defined by the colors and depth.
* **Advanced** - Advanced control over edges defined by lightness, chromacity and depth. We recommend working with this for more faithful results.

### Edge Darkening Intensity
Strength of the edge darkening effect. A higher intensity will concentrate more color on the edges.

	<figcaption>Edge Darkening Intensity between 0 and 3.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Edge Darkening Width
Width for the edge darkening effect. Note: A wider edge darkening will require an increase in intensity, as well.

### Bleeding Radius
Maximum width for the bleeding effect. Pushing this too far might affect performance.

### Drybrush Threshold
Sharpness of the drybrush application.
