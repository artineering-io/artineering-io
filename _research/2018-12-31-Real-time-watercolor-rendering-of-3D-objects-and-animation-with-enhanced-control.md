## Abstract
<div class="abstract">
_The research presented in this thesis pursues two goals, pushing the state-of-the art in watercolor rendering of 3D objects and animation in real-time, while at the same time providing an enhanced, interactive and art-directed control over the stylization._

_Towards these goals, the field of expressive, non-photorealistic rendering is introduced, together with an introduction to the watercolor painting medium and its traditional/digital uses in animation. A literature survey follows, breaking down previous research and approaches towards a watercolor synthesis._

 _The contribution begins addressing existing limitations by introducing a custom painterly 3D material that brings colors to the foreground of shading control and enables dilution of colors and cangiante illumination. More importantly, this material embeds the locally art-directed and procedural stylization parameters that drive the future watercolor effects in a spatially coherent manner._

 _The watercolor stylization is then addressed, by extending and improving upon the palette of watercolor effects, introducing different methods and algorithms to synthesize pigment-, edge-, substrate- and abstraction-based watercolor effects. These include novel approaches towards art-directed color bleeding, dry-brush, gaps & overlaps and dilution in object-space. Together with enhanced and optimized approaches to produce controllable and robust gradient edge darkening, depth aware substrate distortion, substrate granulation and deferred substrate lighting._

 _The contribution is then complemented by presenting the real-time art-direction throughout the interaction spectrum, which is generalized through style control semantics that allow art-directed results to be visualized in different styles within a direct stylization pipeline. This endeavour was implemented in a widely used digital content creation software, which enabled the opportunity to perform two different user-studies involving professional computer graphics artists. The user studies substantiated and validated the contribution of this work, which can be applied in many professional fields that require art-directed 3D graphics._
