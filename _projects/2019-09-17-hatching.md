The _Hatching Stylization_ brings real-time hatching of 3D objects and animation directly within _Autodesk Maya_ through [**MNPRX**](../MNPRX).

This stylization is still in **alpha stage** and is therefore experimental, likely to contain bugs, and should not be considered production-quality at the moment. 
However, you are highly encouraged to try it out on your scenes, push it to its limits, use it in weird and unexpected ways, break it, and send us feedback or suggestions about what you would like to see.

The _Hatching_ style emulates hatching animation that traditionally uses fine, tightly-packed lines to depict shading on objects. However, it can also be used to emulate stippling, by setting a the hatching _length_ to 0 (zero)---as seen in the second example in the video above.

Its main feature are:
* Different hatching roughnesses by changing the stroke/point density
* Strokes/points always stay the same size at different distances
* Strokes/points don't require any UVs on the objects
* Art-direct and control the stroke orientation and width

Hatching is currently very sensitive to the resolution that you are working/rendering with. For best (consistent) results, try to keep the working resolution close to the rendering resolution.

## Style attributes

These attributes specify the global behavior of the hatching style.

### Length
Length of the hatching lines. If set to zero, produces a stippling effect.

	  <source src="/images/MNPRX/HG/length.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
	<figcaption>Varying length between 0 and 40</figcaption>
</figure>

### Width
Average width (thickness) of the hatching lines in pixels. A width of zero is invisible.

	  <source src="/images/MNPRX/HG/width.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
	<figcaption>Varying width between 0 and 6</figcaption>
</figure>

### Gradient
Controls the extent of the diffuse lighting gradient. A value of zero results in a binary shading style.

	<figcaption>Varying gradient between 0 and 2</figcaption>
</figure>

### Smoothness
Smoothes the vector field used to orient the hatching lines. Higher values produce less abrupt changes in orientation.

## Hatching Material

The _hatching_ style requires its own material: to set this material on an object, select an object and load one of the "_hatching" material presets (see [material presets](../material-presets)). Note that this material inherits most of the attributes of the _uber_ material, which control the backdrop of the hatching lines. See [uber](../uber) for a description of those attributes. 

#### Hatching > Density
Controls the overall density of the hatching lines.

<figure class="pull-center">
	<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
	  <source src="/images/MNPRX/HG/density.mp4" style="width:300px" type="video/mp4">
	</video>
	<figcaption>Varying density between 10 and 200</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Hatching > Dynamic Noise
If checked, enables the _fractalization_ pass that ensures a constant line density regardless of camera position and zoom. This sometimes produces a slight "blending effect" when moving. Disable this attribute if your shot keeps the object at the same camera distance and zoom level.

## Art-direction
The width and the local orientation of the hatching lines can be art-directed procedurally with noiseFX and/or locally by painting with paintFX. See [noiseFX](../noiseFX) and [paintFX](../paintFX) for usage information.
