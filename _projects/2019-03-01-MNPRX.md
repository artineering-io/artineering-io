MNPRX is the **professional, customized and actively maintained** version of the open-source [Maya NPR (MNPR)](../Maya-NPR) framework. As such, it is a **direct stylization framework** for _Expressive Rendering_, another common term for _Non-Photorealistic Rendering_ (NPR), directly in the **_Maya_ viewport**. This makes the system instantly **familiar to artists** accustomed to the software.

If you want a quick **introduction**, please watch our founder introduce the **motivation behind MNPRX** in 6 minutes at [**_SIGGRAPH's Real-Time Live!_**](https://youtu.be/hpuEdXn_M0Q?t=3214) in 2017, it can't get more real than that. Since then, MNPRX has **continued to evolve** and now supports **multiple stylizations** with various **new features**.

## Key Features

* Direct stylization pipeline with real-time feedback in the Maya viewport
* Tool palette to art-direct stylizations at multiple levels of control
* Fast rendering of image sequences in EXR at up to 8K resolution
* Powerful and fast [painterly materials](/projects/MNPRX/docs/uber/)
* Motion-coherent substrate-based effects
* Stylization transfer between scenes
* One year of updates and support included with each license
* Customized development through our [R&D packages](/services)
* Growing [documentation](.docs) with learning material

## Add-ons
* Combine art-directed stylization passes of MNPRX with offline rendered passes for unmatched flexibility during compositing in _The Foundry's Nuke_ (more coming in 2019).
