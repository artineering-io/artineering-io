## Advantages over MNPR

* Faster material compilation times
* Motion-coherent substrate-based effects
* Support for displacement maps and transparency
* Render out image sequences in EXR at up to 8K resolution
* Combine art-directed stylized passes and offline rendered passes in _Nuke_
* Transfer the entire stylization from one scene to another
* Thorough and actively maintained [documentation](.docs)
* And much more documented in the [release log](./release-log)
