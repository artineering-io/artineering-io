The Watercolor Stylization brings real-time watercolor rendering of 3D objects and animation directly within the Maya viewport.

It is the first watercolor stylization pipeline of [MNPR](../Maya-NPR) based on algorithms algorithms found in:

* [Art-directed Watercolor Rendered Animation](/articles/Art-directed-Watercolor-Rendered-Animation)
* [Art-directed Watercolor Stylization of 3D Animations in Real-time](/articles/Art-directed-watercolor-stylization-of-3D-animations-in-real-time)
* [Edge- and substrate-based effects for watercolor stylization](/articles/Edge-and-substrate-based-effects-for-watercolor-stylization/)

For visual results, please visit the individual publication posts.

The style is included for **[free in MNPR](../Maya-NPR)** and has been further refined in [MNPRX](/projects/MNPRX) for different production requirements.
