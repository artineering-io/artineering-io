MNPRX is all about art-direction and offering ways for artists to interactively control the 3D render towards their desired vision. Therefore, we offer 4 different levels of control, which help to control the stylization from the highest level of control (Style Presets) to the lowest level of control (PaintFX).

## Style Presets and Attributes
At the top level of control are [_Style Presets_](./style-presets/) (`style` button in the [_MNPRX Shelf_](./shelf/)), which allow you to quickly change the style that MNPRX is currently running in.

</figure>

_Style Presets_ contain and modify attributes from the style [_configuration node_](./conf/), which is the next level of control.

The style [_configuration node_](./conf/) (`conf` button in the [_MNPRX Shelf_](./shelf/)) contains every global parameter available in the active stylization. These parameters are applied over the entire image.
