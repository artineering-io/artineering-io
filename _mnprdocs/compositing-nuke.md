Because **MNPRX is a real-time renderer**, you may want to **integrate offline rendered passes** (i.e., soft shadows, GI, reflection/refraction) with MNPRX to achieve the **final stylized visuals** that you are after.
{: .top2}

For this purpose, we have **recreated some stylizations** within _The Foundry_'s **Nuke**, which are available for MNPRX _Indie_ and _Studio_ subscribers. These stylizations can be [**downloaded** from the _Indie/Studio_ group](https://community.artineering.io/groups/1315682) within the _Artineers_ community. Register in the community and ask for permission to join the group once you have [purchased an _Indie_ or _Studio_ license](/software/MNPRX/#getit) of MNPRX.
