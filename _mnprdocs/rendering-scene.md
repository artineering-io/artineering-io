**Rendering with _MNPRX_ is a breeze** compared to rendering with offline renderers, as every frame is calculated in real-time! In fact, computers normally **take longer to save image files** to disk **than to render them**.

There are many ways to get images out of _Maya_, but we strongly recommend the **tools that we have developed** to get the best and most consistent results, the [**_Viewport Renderer_**](../rendering/#viewport-renderer) (`rendr` icon in the _[MNPRX shelf](../shelf)_) and the [**_Target Sequence Renderer_**](../rendering/#target-sequence-renderer) (`tSeq` icon  in the _[MNPRX shelf](../shelf)_).

In the following **tutorial**, we give a **brief introduction** into **using these tools**.

If you wish to do some **compositing on the rendered image sequences**, make sure to also **[watch the Compositing in Nuke](../compositing-nuke/)** examples.
