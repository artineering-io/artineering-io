Rendering with _MNPRX_ is a breeze compared to rendering with offline renderers, as every frame is calculated in real-time! In fact, computers normally take longer to save image files to disk than to render them.

There are many ways to get images out of _Maya_, but we strongly recommend the tools that we have developed to get the best and most consistent results, the [_Viewport Renderer_](../rendering/#viewport-renderer) (`rendr` icon in the _[MNPRX shelf](../shelf)_) and the [_Target Sequence Renderer_](../rendering/#target-sequence-renderer) (`tSeq` icon  in the _[MNPRX shelf](../shelf)_).

In the following tutorial, we give a brief introduction into using these tools and what to render to [recreate the stylization in a compositing program](../watercolor-nuke), such as Nuke.
