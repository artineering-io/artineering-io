#### What is MNPRX?
MNPRX is a real-time stylized renderer (currently only for Autodesk Mayaâ„¢) with an intuitive toolset for art-direction at different levels-of-control. Check out the available styles in our growing style library <a href="/software/MNPRX/#page-title">here</a>.

#### Will MNPRX work on my system?
Currently, there are versions of MNPRX available for Windows 10. For Linux [CentOS] and Mac, we can only build MNPRX upon request for bulk purchases (more than 10+ licenses).

#### Is my computer strong enough to run MNPRX smoothly?
To run MNPRX smoothly, a modern graphics card (2+GB is recommended). For higher resolutions and scene complexity, more is needed.

#### Can I use MNPRX commercially?
Yes, with the MNPRX Indie Version (for private individuals and teams/small companies up to 10 employees) or MNPRX Studio Version (for big teams and companies with 11 employees and above), which can be purchased <a href="/software/MNPRX/#getit">here</a>.

#### Can I transfer a license to another computer?
Yes, this is possible, but only after 24 hours have passed from a previous activation. Read more about it <a href="/docs/licensing/#license-migration">here</a>.

#### Can I change back to the normal viewport?
<div markdown="1">
<figure class="pull-right">
	<img src="/images/faq/change-renderer.png" alt="Changing renderer in the viewport">
	<figcaption>All viewport renderers are listed here.</figcaption>
</figure>
Yes, just change the viewport renderer from MNPRX to Viewport 2.0.
