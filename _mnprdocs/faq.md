#### What is MNPRX?
MNPRX is a direct stylization framework and real-time stylized renderer (currently only for Autodesk Mayaâ„¢). It enables artists and studios to create unique styles, by using and personalizing one of our already existing styles. Check out the available styles in our growing style library <a href="/software/MNPRX/#page-title">here</a>.

#### Will MNPRX work on my system?
Currently, there are versions of MNPRX available for Windows 10. For Linux [CentOS] and Mac only upon request for bulk purchases.

#### Is my computer strong enough to run MNPRX smoothly?
To run MNPRX smoothly, a modern graphics card (2+GB is recommended). For higher resolutions and scene complexity, more is needed.

#### Can I use MNPRX commercially?
For commercial use, the MNPRX Indie Version (for private individuals and teams/small companies up to 10 employees) and MNPRX Studio Version (for big teams and companies with 11 employees and above) can be purchases <a href="/software/MNPRX/#getit">here</a>.

#### Can I transfer a license to another computer?
Yes, this is possible but only if the software on the previous PC has been inactive for at least 24h. Read more about it <a href="/docs/licensing/#license-migration">here</a>.
