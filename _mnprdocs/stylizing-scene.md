Here you will find tutorial series on stylizing entire scenes with _MNPRX_. The series will showcase the workflow and all the tools involved to stylize example scenes from different productions, with different styles.

The first series features _Shot 040_ from the short film [Run Totti Run](http://runtottirun.com) by _Shad Bradbury_. For this production, we needed to produce a watercolor look that comes as close as possible to the desired stylistic reference, but that follows the shot reference, which is not in the production style.

## Introduction
We start by introducing the shot and the challenge that we are up to.

## Scene Setup
The first thing to do when starting with a new scene, is to set it up accordingly using _MNPRX_. For this purpose, you should try to reuse any existing stylization and use the [Material Presets](../material-presets) tool to give all objects an _MNPRX_ material and prepare them for the stylization.

### Reusing Stylizations
You should always reuse any existing stylization, as this will save preparation time that should be spent refining the style, instead.
