Here you will find **tutorial series** on **stylizing entire scenes** with _MNPRX_. The series will showcase the **workflow** and all the **tools involved** to stylize example scenes from **different productions**, with **different styles**.
{: .top2}

The first series features _Shot 040_ from the short film [Run Totti Run](http://runtottirun.com) by _Shad Bradbury_. For this production, we needed to produce a **watercolor look** that comes as close as possible to the desired **stylistic reference**, but that **follows the shot reference**--which is not in the production style.

## Introduction
We start by **introducing the shot** and the challenge that we are up to.

## Scene Setup
The first thing to do when starting with a new scene, is to **set it up accordingly using MNPRX**. For this purpose, you should try to **reuse any existing stylization** and use the [Material Presets](../material-presets) tool to **give all objects an _MNPRX_ material** and prepare them for the stylization.

### Reusing Stylizations
One should **always reuse any existing stylization**, as this will save setup time that should be spent refining the style, instead. We can use the [Import/Export Tool](../import-export/) in the MNPRX toolbox for this purpose.

### Initial Materials
Before stylizing, one should **setup the scene** by assigning **MNPRX materials to all objects** in the scene using the [Material Presets](../material-presets) tool.

### Initial Lighting
Once the materials are set, one can setup the **initial lighting** of the scene with one main light and its casted shadow.

## Matching Materials
With the initial lighting set, we can **modify the materials** in the scene to **approach the reference** shot image.

## Matching Lighting
With the materials set, we can **refine the lighting** in the scene to approach the lighting in the **reference shot** image.

## NoiseFX
Once the materials and lighting have been matched, its time to **add procedural watercolor effects** that will speed up the stylization process with the [**NoiseFX** tool](../noisefx/).

## PaintFX
With the NoiseFX in place, its time to **refine the materials** further and **modify the effects locally** by using [**PaintFX**](../paintfx/).

## Proxies
Once the PaintFX are in place, we can **refine the stylization using proxies** to stylize entire volumes within the 3D scene.
Proxies can be added at **any stage in the stylization**, either at the beginning, middle or at the end. It really depends on every artist's workflow.

## Attaching Proxies Onto Objects (optional)
If you want to **attach proxies onto objects**, you can also watch this tutorial, where we attach two proxy planes onto the two hero characters, to highlight them.

## Rendering
After the stylization is complete, you need to [**render the stylized scene**](../rendering-scene/) as an image sequence for best results.
