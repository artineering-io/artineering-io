## MNPRX licensing basics

Purchasing MNPRX grants you a license that allows you to use the full functionality of MNPRX. This license takes the form of an activation code that is sent to you (typically by email) alongside your copy of MNPRX.
If you did not receive an activation code, please [contact us](/contact/).

A single MNPRX license can be active on only one computer at a time.
**An internet connection is required for running the licensed version of MNPRX**. Running the Demo version does not require any internet connection.


## Activating a license
In order to use the full version of MNPRX on a computer, you need to activate your license.
The first time MNPRX is run, you will be prompted with the following dialog:

<figure class="pull-center">
	<img src="/images/MNPRX/licensing/first-time.png" alt="First-time activation dialog" style="max-width: 100%;">
	<figcaption>First-time activation dialog.</figcaption>
</figure>

Choose **Activate with key** to activate a purchased license for this computer and have access to the full functionality of MNPRX.
If you did not purchase MNPRX, **Activate demo** will activate the demo version of MNPRX on this on this computer, with limited resolution.
If you don't want to activate your license now, click **Cancel** to run MNPRX as demo this time only. You will be prompted again the next time Maya starts.

After clicking **Activate with key**, enter the activation code that you received when purchasing MNPRX:

<figure class="pull-center">
	<img src="/images/MNPRX/licensing/activation-code-prompt.png" alt="Enter activation code." style="max-width: 100%;">
	<figcaption>Enter your activation code in the text box and click OK.</figcaption>
</figure>

After MNPRX checks that the key is valid, and if the license has not yet been activated, you will be prompted with the End-User-License Agreement (EULA):

<figure class="pull-center">
	<img src="/images/MNPRX/licensing/eula.png" alt="End-User-License Agreement dialog" style="max-width: 100%;">
	<figcaption>End-User-License Agreement (EULA).</figcaption>
</figure>

Once you have read and agree to the End-User License Agreement, click on **I Agree**. You will then be asked to activate your license on the computer. Click **Activate** to confirm and activate, or **Cancel** to abort activation.

	<img src="/images/MNPRX/licensing/activation-confirmation.png" alt="Confirm activation" style="max-width: 100%;">
	<figcaption>Confirm activation by clicking Activate.</figcaption>
</figure>

## License migration
Licenses can be migrated (transferred) between computers after 24 hours have passed since a prior activation.
**If you try to migrate the license before 24 hours have passed, activation in the new computer will fail**.

After inputting the activation code on another computer, you will be prompted to confirm the migration of the license.
Click **Activate** to confirm, or **Cancel** to abort activation and run as demo for this session.

After a successful migration, the license in the other computer will automatically deactivate and you can use MNPRX in the new computer.

## Activation failure
In case the activation code is not valid, or the existing license is no longer valid, an error message will appear.
**Retry** will prompt you to enter a valid activation code, and **Cancel** will run MNPRX as demo this session.
