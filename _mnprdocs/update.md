MNPRX is updated almost every month, so its important to stay current to continue being able to render and benefit from all the latest features. Fortunately, updating is even easier than installing MNPRX.

## Replacing MNPRX
The easiest way to update MNPRX is by replacing the existing files with the ones from the new version.
1. Download the latest MNPRX version and unzip all files.
1. With the _Maya_ application closed, replace all the existing MNPRX files with the new ones.
1. Start _Maya_ and continue using MNPRX as you always have.

## New Install
If you'd like to keep the old version or start fresh, unzip all files and install the new version of MNPRX from a different directory, following the [installation instructions](../installation#installation).

## Updating materials
{: #materials}
Some updates require you to update the existing _ShaderFX_ materials in the scene to take advantage of new features. This is done in the _MNPRX shelf_, by right clicking on the _mPre_ tool -> _Update ShaderFX materials_.
