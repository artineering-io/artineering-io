To get a trial or full version of MNPRX, please [send me an email](mailto:santiago@artineering.io?subject=Request for MNPRX) with the following information:

* Company name and/or project name/codename
* Nature of the project i.e., commercial, non-commercial
* Desired style (the more defined the style is, the better)
* Estimated production timeline
* Additional production requests

I'll get back to you as soon as possible to figure out how we can work together to make your stylized vision a reality.

I hope to hear from you soon and thanks for your consideration!
