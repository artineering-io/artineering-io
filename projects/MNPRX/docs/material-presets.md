## FAQ
_**I prep my objects, but they come out white, what can I do?**_<br>
This issue happens when the dimensions of the scene are too big, and the atmosphere color fully kicks in (which by default is white). It will be fixed in future versions, but you can change the atmosphere limits in your `Object-space shader -> Additional Object-Space Effects -> Atmosphere Start/End_`. If you set the atmosphere _start_ higher than the _end_, no atmosphere color should affect the shader.
