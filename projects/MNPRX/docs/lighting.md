<!-- The art-directable shading strongly depends on the _Diffuse Factor_ attribute of the material. This means that it the shading will only go as dark or as light as the diffuse factor allows it to be (1->fully shaded/lit, 0->no shading at all). An additional shade attribute controls how much diffuse shading from the lights in the scene should be visible. This allows for a combination between art-directed shading and shading from the light sources. -->
