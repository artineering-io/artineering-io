Alex is increasingly getting tired of adult life. Her daily routine is restricted by norms and expectations of the modern world where social media has replaced human interactions. But things change when she sees Bacchus.

BACCHUS was made by a team of 3rd-year Character Animation & CG Art students at The Animation Workshop/VIA University College in Viborg, Denmark. The production quality is excellent for a student production.

**Stylized Highlights**
* Animated in two's
* Harsher shading modulated by grain
* Edgy 3D designs with blunt colors
* Round/organic 2D design with saturated colors
* Surreal blend between 3D and 2D
