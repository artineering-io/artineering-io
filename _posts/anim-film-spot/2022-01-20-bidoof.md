Academy Award-nominated [Taiko Studios](http://www.taikostudios.com/) brings us a Pok√©mon story showcasing the struggles of finding one's purpose and the friendship between a trainer and his Bidoof.

**Stylized Highlights**
* Frayed edges that move with the underlaying animation with the help of MNPRX
* Frayed edges applied selectively on different objects and vertices
* Arnold/MNPRX integration in Nuke
