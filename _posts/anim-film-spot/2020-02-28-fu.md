Academy Award-nominated [Taiko Studios](http://www.taikostudios.com/) brings us a story of a family during Chinese New Year and the relativity of everyone's "home".

Check out the project blog [here](http://www.taikostudios.com/fuacute-airbnb.html)

**Highlights**
* Frayed edges that move with the underlying animation though MNPRX
* Arnold/MNPRX integration in Nuke
* Use of color and painted backgrounds
