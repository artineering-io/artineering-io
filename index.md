We are [**passionate developers**](/about) crafting software to **render stylized 3D imagery and animations, in real-time**.

We believe in the unlimited possibilities of the 3D medium, but found ourselves artistically constrained by renderers that force a predefined photorealistic aesthetic. So, we decided to create our [**own renderer**](/projects/MNPRX) and to [**offer our expertise**](/services) to help studios and artists **achieve any desired style, in real-time**.

Make sure to follow us [@artineering](http://twitter.com/artineering) for the latest news about our [projects](/projects/) and [research](/research).

If you like what you find and would like to work with us, make sure to [drop us a line](/contact)!
