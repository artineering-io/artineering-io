#### Re-activating MNPRX after activating another version
<div markdown="1">
If you previously activated a Demo version and wish to activate another license, follow these steps:
1. Delete the `MNPRX.lic` file found in:
  * "Only for you" installations -> `Documents/maya/MNPRX.lic`
  * "For all users" installations -> `Program Files/Common Files/Autodesk Shared/Modules/Maya/MNPRX.lic`
2. Start or restart Maya if already opened
3. Load MNPRX and activate it with your license key

#### My activation failed with the activation code that was given
<div markdown="1">
If for some reason activation fails, make sure to try the following:
* Double-check the entered activation code.
* Check that your subscription has not expired and that you have not activated all available licenses within the past 24 hours.
* Delete the license file to reset the license, restart _Maya_ and try to activate again. The license file can be in two places depending on the MNPRX installation method.
  * User-based installation:
    * (Windows) `<username>/Documents/maya/MNPRX.lic`
  * All-users installation:
    * (Windows) `C:/Program Files/Common Files/Autodesk Shared/Modules/Maya/MNPRX.lic`
</div>
