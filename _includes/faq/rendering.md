#### The render comes out shifted when rendering with TAA
This will happen when the `2D Pan/Zoom` is used in the camera you are rendering (`Camera Shape Attributes -> Display Options -> 2D Pan/Zoom`). We discourage from using this function with MNPRX at the moment, but we might add this in the future if [requested by the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/artineers/).
